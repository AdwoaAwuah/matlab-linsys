This package of functions was modified by Pablo A. Iturralde (piturralde at ieee dot org) on Jan 2019.
The only files that were changed:
SmoothLDS.c
Makefile
SmoothLDS.m (this file may be removed in future versions and all other .m files were removed)
Changes include:
- Handling of missing (NaN) data in observations.
- Minor changes in variable types to make compilation compatible with 64 bit systems.

%%%%%%%% ORIGINAL README %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The Matlab files in this directory implement system identification of a Linear
Dynamical System (LDS) of the form

   x(t+1) = A*x(t) + B*u(t) + q(t)
   y(t)   = C*x(t) + D*w(t) + r(t)
   cov([q,r])=[Q 0; 0 R]

The algorithm is the expectation-maximization (EM) identification algorithm
developed by Shumway and Stoffer (1982) and Ghahramani and Hinton (1996).  The
E-Step consists of Kalman Smoothing, the M-Step is solved exactly.

This implementation is based heavily on code by Zoubin Ghahramani.

Files:
  DemoLDS.m		    Short demo on how to use the code, please look at source
  IdentifyLDS.m		Main function to estimate parameters of LDS
  LikelihoodLDS.m	Return the log likelihood of data given the LDS
  MStep.m		    Called by IdentifyLDS for M-Step
  SimulateLDS.m		Generate output of LDS.
  SmoothLDS.m		Kalman smoother, called by IdentifyLDS for E-Step

  SmoothLDS.c		Much faster C implementation of Kalman smoother. 
			Use "make" to compile for use with matlab, change 
			variable MEX in Makefile to point to your Matlab compiler.
  other *.h *.c		Auxiliary files needed by SmootLDS.c

See, e.g. "help IdentifyLDS" for syntax of functions.

The C implementation of the Kalman smoother, SmoothLDS.c, is much faster (in one
test by 20x) than the Matlab m-file. To compile the mex object file on Unix or
similar systems:

1. in Makefile change the path "MEX = /usr/local/matlab-7sp1/bin/mex" to point
   to your local Matlab compiler.
2. compile with "make" at the command line.
