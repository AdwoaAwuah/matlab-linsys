# matlab-sysID
System Identification toolbox for Matlab

v0: ONLY identifies a purely deterministic, arbitrary size, LTI-SSM assuming real & different poles, and a constant input. Uses sPCA.


Future work:
- Work with any aribtrary input signal (not just constant ones)
- Allow complex & double poles
- Estimate stochastic components [Kalman-like, see Cheng & Sabes 2006]
